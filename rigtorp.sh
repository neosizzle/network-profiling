# Hyper-threading (HT) or Simultaneous multithreading (SMT) is a technology to maximize processor resource usage for workloads with low instructions per cycle (IPC). Since HT/SMT increases contention on processor resources itâ€™s recommended to turn it off if you want to reduce jitter introduced by contention on processor resources. Disabling HT / SMT has the additional benefit of doubling (in case of 2-way SMT) the effective L1 and L2 cache available to a thread.
# [EXPERIMENTAL]
sudo echo off > /sys/devices/system/cpu/smt/control

# To verify that SMT / HT is disabled the output of the following command should be 0:
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/smt/active

# Turbo boost and governor ommited due to lack of hardware support on prod

# TODO check if can overclock prod processors (no xeon)

# [TWEAK NEEDED]
# nohz_full - disable timers on core
# rch_nocb - disable rcu callbacks (for queuing lock operations) on core
# isolcpu - isolate cores from kernel scheduler [REBOOT NEEDED]
# mitigations - disable CPU security mitigations
# use cat /proc/cmdline to verify
sudo sed -i '/^GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=/ s/"\(.*\)"/"\1 isolcpus=1-7 nohz_full=1-7 rcu_nocbs=1-7 mitigations=off"/' /etc/default/grub

# Try to move all kernel threads and workqueues to core 0:
sudo pgrep -P 2 | xargs -i taskset -p -c 0 {}

# disable sqap to redice pagefaults

# disable TLB, which makes kernel not promote normal pages into huge pages
# this promotion causus latency spike
