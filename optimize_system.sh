# When a network card receives packets and before the kernel protocol stack processes them, the kernel stores these packets in backlog queues. The kernel maintains a separate queue for each CPU core.
# If the backlog queue for a core is full, the kernel drops all further incoming packets that the netif_receive_skb() kernel function assigns to this queue. If the server contains a 10 Gbps or faster network adapter or multiple 1 Gbps adapters, tune the backlog queue size to avoid this problem.

# Hyper-threading (HT) or Simultaneous multithreading (SMT) is a technology to maximize processor resource usage for workloads with low instructions per cycle (IPC). Since HT/SMT increases contention on processor resources itâ€™s recommended to turn it off if you want to reduce jitter introduced by contention on processor resources. Disabling HT / SMT has the additional benefit of doubling (in case of 2-way SMT) the effective L1 and L2 cache available to a thread.
